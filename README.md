ADB Wireless source has gone missing, cloning it if needed here.

Google Play Link
----------

For some odd reason I can't find the original App in Google Play when I search for ["siir.es.adbWireless" (play.google.com/store/search?q=siir.es.adbWireless&c=apps)](http://view.xscreenshot.com/9d12e0f2c041333743220545dc70d57c) or ["adbWireless" (play.google.com/store/search?q=adbWireless&c=apps)](http://view.xscreenshot.com/44a42dbf0cea748b57afb3782bf96fed) and from my "My Apps" list it is vanished too, though still installed. Anyway, I found the [Google Play **Direct-Link**](http://view.xscreenshot.com/ef15898fc628ce5ccaeeb8b8260bf547) still working. 
  
So, in case you're searching for, here it is: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=siir.es.adbWireless](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=siir.es.adbWireless) ;)
