==========

ADB Wireless source has gone missing, cloning it if needed here.

> _For some odd reason I can not find the original App in Google Play when I search [for "siir.es.adbWireless"](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=siir.es.adbWireless&c=apps) or [for "adbWireless"](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=adbWireless&c=apps) and from my "My Apps" list it is vanished too, though still installed. Anyway, I found the [Google Play **Direct-Link**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=siir.es.adbWireless) still working! ;)_
